AgentDiagram DSL syntax:
- Comments start with // and extend to end of line.
- Groups:    Name [color: COLOR, icon: ICON] { ...children... }
- Nodes:     Name [color: COLOR, icon: ICON]
- Edges:     Source > Target           (forward)
             Source < Target           (reverse)
             Source <> Target          (bidirectional)
             Source -- Target          (dashed/related)
             Source => Target          (thick / primary path)
- Edge labels: Source > Target: label text
- Names CAN contain spaces, pipes (|), and ampersands (& or "and").
- Names MUST NOT contain "/" (slash), "," (comma), "{", or "}". Replace path separators like "api/v1/users" with spaces or hyphens: "api v1 users".
- Attribute blocks [color: X, icon: Y] must be preceded by exactly one space after the name and never appear inside or after a "{...}" block.
- "--" is the dashed-edge operator, NOT a comment or description. Use "// text" for all inline comments — never "--".
- Edge operators must be whitespace-surrounded so names can include "|" etc.
- Valid colors: ${COLOR_NAMES.join(', ')}.
- Output ONLY DSL. No code fences. No prose outside // comments.
